# Elder Scrolls Character Creator

An Angular application for creating Elder Scrolls characters with AI-generated backstories and images for Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim!

Take note: *THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND DOESN'T REALLY WORK... yet. There's a ton of placeholders and such*

Also, at this point this *should* work on your mobile device of choice... but I have not made this mobile-first in the slightest so take that *should* very litterally and with a massive pinch of salt.

## Features

- Select from Morrowind, Oblivion, or Skyrim
- Choose from authentic races and classes from the Elder Scrolls universe
- Generate character backstories with AI (OpenAI integration ready)
- Generate character portraits with AI (DALL-E integration ready)
- Save multiple characters for later reference
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
